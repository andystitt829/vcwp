# VCWP - A WordPress theme for Virtual Coffee

VCWP is a starter WordPress theme for the Virtual Coffee brownbag. It is built with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and PHP.

VCWP is kept intentionally minimal so you can focus in on the fewest amount of features needed to be an active, working WordPress theme.

## Installing VCWP

To start playing with VCWP, you'll need a local WordPress installation. [LocalWP](https://localwp.com/) is an easy, free option that requires just a few clicks and no complex configurations.

To install the theme, download this code into: your-root-folder/app/public/wp-content/themes/vcwp/

Then, log into the WordPress admin area (https://your-local-url/wp-admin) and go to Appearance > Themes, then click "Activate" on the VCWP theme.

The website content that was used in the brownbag is WordPress theme unit test data. It can be downloaded from the [Theme Unit Test page](https://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Unit_Test), which also contains instructions on how to import it.
